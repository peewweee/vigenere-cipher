# vigenere-cipher

*A program that translates the user inputted message and key, then outputs the ciphertext*

**Vigenere Cipher Description**
>The VigenÃ¨re cipher works by using a "key" to determine the shift value for each letter in the message. The key is repeated as many times as necessary to match the length of the message. Then, each letter of the message is shifted by the corresponding letter of the key, wrapping around the alphabet as necessary.

**Try to run and use the program**
>1. With your IDE, run the program.
>2. The program will ask you to input a message, try to input: THISISTHELASTTASKHOORDAY
>3. The program will then ask you to input a key,  try to input: KNIGHTS
>4. Wait for the loading animation
>5. The program will output the ciphertext of the message

**Uses**
>- pyfiglet module - for fonts and sizes
>- time module - to manipulate time values
>- for, if, and else statements
